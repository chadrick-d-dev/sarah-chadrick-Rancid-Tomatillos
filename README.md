## Strategy to Build our App

This is our first project using react, where we learned how to code in javascript with jsx, and how to write unit/integration/asynchronous tests. We were tasked with building a simple movie rating application. Our first objective was learning how to get movies to display using react. Next we added a feature where a user could click on a movie to view a new page with more details about that movie along with a button to return to the home view. We also had to use asynchronous javascript to fetch from the api for both movies on home page, and single displayed movie. An additional feature we added was a dropdown button that a user could use to view movies within a range of ratings.

## Usage
#### 

## Challenges
* After we added Router to our application all of our tests failed. We were able to successfully research ways to get our tests to past.
* Deployment was challenging, but we were able to resolve our setbacks with teamwork.

## Roadmap

The total time allotted for this project was approximately 15 days. Future features contemplated by the developers include the following:

* Improving the CSS
* Adding a feature for user to search by genre
* Adding a feature for user to rate movies

See the [open issues](https://github.com/chadrick-d-dev/sarah-chadrick-Rancid-Tomatillos/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
